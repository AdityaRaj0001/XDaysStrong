## Overview

XDaysStrong is a simple web app designed to help you break free from one habit. The app tracks your progress with a growing streak that is visualized by a Fire. Each time you check in, the Fire grows bigger, and your streak increases. But be careful â€” if you miss a day, your streak resets to zero.

## How It Works

1. **Click to Check In:** Every day, click the "I'm Here ðŸš€" button. To maintain your streak, check in again within 24 hours.
2. **Watch the Fire Grow:** With each check-in, your Fire grows bigger, representing your commitment and progress.
3. **Stay on Track:** If you miss a day, your streak resets to zero, so stay consistent!

## Features

- **Simple Check-In:** Click a button to mark your progress.
- **Growing Streak:** Your streak increases with each successful check-in.

## Motivation
